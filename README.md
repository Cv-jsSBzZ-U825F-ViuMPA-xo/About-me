# Hello
I'm surprised you actually clicked this, But here we are.

For clarification.
If your looking for the creator of Apophenia,Reaper,Jester,Arcaurs,Volta,Floating Girl, Redsign, Thats not me.
That's reap (reap4985)


With that out of the way...
Hello, I'm fem.
I don't exploit, Or even play roblox anymore.
I have been scripting in LUAU since 2017-2022 (5 years, Time flies huh?)


If you want to message me, I'm fine with it, Even if it's just a simple hi, I'll respond back im fine with it.

I've behind the scenes contributed to **all** of reaps TSB scripts (Including the redsign rework!)

I make script concepts for reap, And they usually apply them, Even if they don't— I don't mind.

If your wondering why im even still apart of TSB yet alone roblox's community, It's because of an odd feeling of nostalgia.

Here's some questions i wanted to answer, Even if nobody asked them.

Where did i and reap meet?
Soulshatters.

About soulshatters, I really, Really loved the community before.
It was so innocent, But also just so far apart from most communities.
I don't know if it's simply nostalgia washing me, Or if it truly was like that— Every memory is unclear.
What i do remember though, Is great memories of the past that i wish to return to.


But, The TSB community isn't something i really like, But it's the closest to the soulshatters community that i have, With some familiar faces, Even if some don't even recognize me or even know me at the first place, It makes me happy to see them.

Thank you for reading my message, If you even read it though.
This may get updated every now and then.
